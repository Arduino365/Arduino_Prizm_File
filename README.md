# Arduino_Prizm_File
File used in unison with TELEOP.h and PRIZM.h

This file is used to shorten your code and make it look better, I recommend only using this code as long as you have a grasp on what you are doing with your code. I think I will charge 5$ per person to get this file. This is an actual library that you will include in each code.

Updates coming often.
